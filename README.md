Evolutionary Algorithm Differential Evolution

Differential evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm but is specifically designed for continuous optimization problems. It focuses on differential mutations of the population members to explore the search space. It is efficient for high-dimensional, non-convex, and non-linear optimization problems.
